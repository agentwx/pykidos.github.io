# PyKidos: Python visual playground in the browser

Welcome to [**PyKidos**](https://pykidos.github.io/)! This is a small Javascript application (still rough around  the edges) that provides a Python playground running entirely in the browser, which is convenient for teaching purposes.

[![PyKidos:](https://github.com/pykidos/pykidos.github.io/assets/1942359/7974ace5-aeb6-4a6c-8678-c40ed5eb0af0)](https://pykidos.github.io/)

The grid cells (color and text) can be manipulated from Python. You can make simple grid animations and react to click and keyboard events.

Kids (and adults) can program toy games to learn basic Python coding skills.
